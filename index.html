            <p>Flavian emperor Vespasian had this amphitheatre that could accommodate 65,000 spectators built in the year 72 CE. 
              Construction of the Colosseum took eight years and was financed with plunder taken from Jerusalem. The Colosseum, 
              also called the Amphitheatrum Flavium, was opened by emperor Titus with games and festivities that lasted 100 days 
              and cost the lives of 5,000 animals.</p>

            between autumn and spring.The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs
            when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different
            dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.</p>

            <p>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding
            winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but
            local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When
            it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and
            vice versa.</p>

    <h3>Learn all about its history</h3>
    <p id="pabout">The main purpose of the Colosseum in Rome was to entertain the people – 
      and thereby increase the popularity of the emperor – with gladiator battles, sometimes 
      including wild animals, such as elephants and tigers. It was common for animal fights 
      to be held in the mornings by the ‘bestiarii’. During intermissions, convicted criminals 
      were often thrown to the wild animals. Gladiator battles were held in the afternoons. 
      As Christianity become more important, the barbaric games were finally forbidden by emperor 
      Honorius in 404 CE. The public lynching of a monk who tried to end a fight between two 
      gladiators was the final straw. Until the year 523, only shows with wild animals were held there.</p>

      <h3>Facts 'Il Colosseo'</h3>
      <p id="p2">Emperor Domitian, Titus' successor, later expanded the amphitheatre with an extra storey and a number of spaces underneath the Colosseum. 
        This made the Colosseum of Rome the largest amphitheatre in Roman history, and it is considered one of the seven wonders of the world.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-row">
          <h3>History of the Colosseum</h3>
          <p id="p2">The amphitheatre could be accessed via 80 entrance arches, and the name ‘Colosseum’ (or Coliseum) was based on the colossal 
            statue of Emperor Nero (Colossus of Nero) that stood next to the amphitheatre in those days.</p>

          <div class="about-row">
              <h3>Would you like to visit the Colosseum?</h3>
              <p id="p2">For a relaxed visit to the Colosseum Rome, we strongly recommend reserving Colosseum tickets in advance. Unfortunately, 
                long queues at the regular ticket window are very common. This combined ticket also gives you access to the Forum Romanum and the Palatine.</p>
